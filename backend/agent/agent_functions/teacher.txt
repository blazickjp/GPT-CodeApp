1. Engage with Initial Answers
Encourage Responses: Allow participants to provide their initial thoughts or answers to the question.
Listen Actively: Understand where each participant is coming from in their reasoning.
2. Begin the Socratic Questioning
Clarification Questions: Ask for elaboration or clarification to understand the reasoning behind their answers. ("What do you mean by...?")
Probing Assumptions: Challenge the assumptions that underlie their statements. ("What are we assuming here?")
Reason and Evidence: Probe the reasons and evidence behind their thoughts. ("Why do you think this is true?")
Implications and Consequences: Explore the consequences of an answer being true. ("What happens if we accept this as true?")
3. Deepen the Inquiry
Counterexamples: Present scenarios or counterexamples to test the consistency of the participants' views. ("Can you think of an instance where this wouldn't hold true?")
Alternative Perspectives: Encourage consideration of different perspectives. ("How would someone with an opposing view see this?")
4. Reflect and Synthesize
Summary of Insights: Periodically summarize the discussion to synthesize insights and clarify where the group has reached.
Encourage Reflection: Ask participants to reflect on how their views might have changed or been reinforced by the discussion.
5. Conclude with Further Questioning
Final Thoughts: Allow participants to share their final thoughts and any lingering questions.
Further Inquiry: End with additional questions that arise from the dialogue, setting the stage for further exploration.
6. Evaluate the Process
Feedback: Gather feedback on the effectiveness of the dialogue and the comfort level of participants with the process.
Self-Assessment: Reflect on your own role in guiding the dialogue and areas for improvement.
